# 4-Bit Arithmetic Logic Unit

A 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is designed and implemented in Verilog. It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, AND, OR, and XOR operations.

## Installation

This Verilog code is implemented in XILINX Vivado.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    
    ```
    git clone <https://github.com/esha-23/4-bit-ALU.git>
    
    ```
    
2. Open XILINX Vivado and create a new project.
3. Add the Verilog source files from the cloned repository to your project.
4. Synthesize and implement the design.

## Features

- **Addition:** Adds two 4-bit numbers.
- **Subtraction:** Subtracts one 4-bit number from another.
- **Multiplication:** Multiplies two 4-bit numbers using booths algorithm.
- **Division:** Divides one 4-bit number by another.
- **AND:** Computes the bitwise AND of two 4-bit numbers.
- **OR:** Computes the bitwise OR of two 4-bit numbers.
- **XOR:** Computes the bitwise XOR of two 4-bit numbers.
